# Omics data Integration workflow using R

## Overview
Welcome to the Omics Data Integration with R repository! This repository provides an R script designed to facilitate the integration of multiple omics datasets (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) using the DIABLO method of the mixOmics package. By combining insights from diverse datasets, researchers can gain a holistic view of biological systems and uncover novel insights.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Combines multiple omics datasets using advanced statistical or machine learning techniques.

- **Visualization**: Generates intuitive visualizations to explore the integrated data.

- **Customizable**: Allows users to adapt the script to their specific datasets and objectives.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/psolev/Integration_workflow.git

Navigate to the repository directory:

cd Integration_workflow

## Usage

1. Normalize your omics datasets (log normalization is recommended).
2. Prepare your omics datasets with samples in rows and features in columns. Make sure you have the same samples in all datasets.
3.  Update the script with the paths and names of your datasets.
4.  Customize any parameters as needed.
5.  Run the script in R:

source("DIABLO_script.R")

6. View the output files and visualizations in the specified output directory.
